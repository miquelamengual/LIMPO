# LIMPO
## What is Limpo?
Limpo, a user-friendly commodity for students to efficiently order cleaning services at reasonable prices.

## Why Limpo?
The idea was born from seeing the struggle of students to handle work, social life, and household duties. We want students to have time to enjoy their lives without having to worry about cleaning, improving this way their student experience. Thus, we created a user-friendly mobile application designed by students for students in the city of Madrid that want a clean home away from home.
